# Quest for Thiccness
This a GYM webb-app that is also hosted on GitHub pages Link: https://romanrumba.github.io/quest-for-thiccness/
I wrote this because of two things:
1. I am too cheap to pay a subscription for a gym app
3. This is a lot more cooler to reference this than having "About Me" page on your CV. 

## Tools used
This web-app is written in Angular version 15 and for the styling framework I use PrimeNG version 15 along with some custom scss.

## Shoutout
The exercise information was obtained from https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json, I used their amazing work to create a database of my own.
